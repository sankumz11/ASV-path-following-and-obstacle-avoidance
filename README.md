# ASV-path-following-and-obstacle-avoidance
This project successfully demonstrates the Autonomous Surface Vehicle
(ASV)'s ability to navigate complex environments using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). The model effectively balances path adherence with
collision avoidance, enabling the ASV to navigate efficiently through static
environments. The reinforcement learning approach allows the ASV to
learn optimal behaviors based on continuous feedback, ensuring both
safety and path accuracy.
